Creating a custom Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework in PHP can be a challenging but rewarding task. 

MVC is a design pattern that separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. 

This separation allows for better code organization and the ability to make changes to the application without 
affecting other parts of the code. 

In this post, weâ€™ll walk through the steps of building a simple MVC framework in PHP that 
will help you understand the basics of MVC and how to build your own.
