                    <p> The above code defines a route for the homepage. Every time this route receives a get request for /, It will return the view welcome. Views are the frontend of the application and I will discuss the topic in an upcoming installment of this series.</p>
                    <p> All Laravel routes are defined in your route files, which are found within the routes directory. Your applicationâ€™s AppProvidersRouteServiceProvider consequently stacks these records. The routes/web.php record defines routes that are for your web interface.</p>
                    <p> The structure of the route is very simple. Open the appropriate file (either `web.php` or `api.php`) and start the code with `Route::` This is followed by the request you want to assign to that specific route and then comes the function that will be executed as a result of the request.</p>
                    <p> Laravel offers the following route methods:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> get</li>
                        <li> post</li>
                        <li> put</li>
                        <li> delete</li>
                        <li> patch</li>
                        <li> options</li>
                    </ol>


                   
                    <table class="table table-bordered">

                                <td>The PATCH HTTP method is believed to be non-idempotent. That means, if you retry the request multiple times, you will end up having multiple resources with different URIs.</td>
