They are both variables. But $message is a variable with a fixed name. $$message is a variable who’s name is stored in $message. For example, if $message contains “var”, $$message is the same as $var.


$x = "abc";  
$$x = 200;  
echo $x."<br/>";  // abc
echo $$x."<br/>"; // 200  
echo $abc; // 200
